(** {1:manual Manual}

{!Topkg} is a package builder for distributing OCaml software. It
provides a mechanism to describe an opam
{{:http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/manual/dev-manual.html#sec25}[.install]
file} according to the build environment and make corresponding
invocations in your build system. This simple mechanism brings the
following advantages:
{ol
{- It frees you from implementing an install procedure in your build
   system: this task is delegated to {{:http://opam.ocaml.org}OPAM} or
   to the [opam-installer] tool.}
{- It doesn't reclaim control over your build system. It will only
   invoke it {e once} with a list of targets determined from a package
   description and a build environment explicitely specified on the
   command line.}}

{!Topkg} has been designed with [ocamlbuild] in mind but it should be
usable with any other build system as long as it is able to understand
the targets topkg {{!map}generates}.

{!Topkg} is a single ISC licensed OCaml library without dependencies
that you add to you project build dependencies. It also provides the
[topkg] command line tool that will help you to streamline your
release process.

{1:setup Basic setup}

Your repository and release archive should have the following files.
{ul
{- [pkg/META], a
    {{:http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html}Findlib}
    [META] file. That you should install in the [lib] directory
    of the package (see below).}
{- [pkg/pkg.ml], the package description written with {!Topkg}.
   See {{!descr}package description.}}
{- [_tags] ocamlbuild file with at least the [true : bin_annot] line.
   See {{!cmt}handling cmt and cmti} files for details.}
{- [opam], your package metadata, its dependencies and the instructions
   to build it. The [depends:] fields must have a ["topkg" {build}] line.}}

{b Note.} If you start a new library,
{{:http://erratique.ch/software/carcass}[carcass]} allows
you to:
{[
carcass body topkg/pkg mypkg
(cd mypkg && git init && git add . && git commit -m "First commit.")
opam pin add -kgit mypkg mypkg#master
]}
to make your library [{opam,ocamlfind}]-able with correct version
watermarks on releases and opam pins.

{1:build Package build instructions}

The build instructions of your package are simply an invocation of
[pkg/pkg.ml] with the [build] argument and a specification of the
build environment on the command line. Here is for example how you
should write that invocation in the [build:] field of the [opam] file
of a hypothetical [mypkg] package:
{v
build: [[
  "ocaml" "pkg/pkg.ml" "build"
          "human" "false" ]]
v}

This invocation will execute your build system with a set of targets
determined from the build environment specified on the command line
and generate, in the root directory of your distribution a
[mypkg.install] file that OPAM will use to install and uninstall your
package.

Note that there is no need to specify anything in the [remove:] field
of the [opam] file and there is no need to invoke [ocamlfind] with
your [META] file, simply install the latter in the [lib] section (see below).

If you need to support another package system you can invoke
[pkg/pkg.ml] as above and then manage the installation and
uninstallation at a given [$DESTDIR] using the generated
[mypkg.install] file and the [opam-installer] tool distributed with
OPAM or you own [.install] file interpreter.

{1:descr Package description}

An OPAM [.install] file is a description of a standard UNIX
install. It has fields for each of the standard directories [lib],
[bin], [man], [etc], etc. Each of these fields lists the files to
install in the corresponding directory (or subdirectories). See the
{{:http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/manual/dev-manual.html#sec25}[.install]
file specification} in the OPAM developer manual for more information.

In {!Topkg}, the package description file [pkg/pkg.ml] is simply:
{ol
{- A {{!section:Pkg.builder}builder specification}. It specifies the
   build tool that is invoked once with the files to build and install
   as determined by the current build environment.}
{- A specification of the files to install according to the build
   environment by specifying invoking install field functions.

one wants build to put in each field
   of the package's [.install] file by invoking install field
   functions [Pkg.{lib,bin,doc,...}]}}

Here is an example of a [pkg/build.ml] description for a single module
library that also installs a command line tool called [jsontrip]. Don't
worry about the sheer length of the description we'll soon cut down
on the number of lines.
{[
#!/usr/bin/env ocaml
#use "topfind"
#require "topkg"
open Topkg

let () =
  Pkg.describe "jsonm" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.mli";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmti";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmi";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cma";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmx";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.a";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmxa";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmxs";
    Pkg.bin "test/jsontrip.byte";
    Pkg.bin "test/jsontrip.native";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md"; ]
]}

This says that we are declaring a package named [jsonm] which means
that the generated install file will be [jsonm.install]. It also says
that we are using [ocamlbuild] as a build tool and that we want all the
files specified with [Pkg.lib] to be installed the [lib] directory,
those with [Pkg.bin] in [bin], those with [Pkg.doc] in [doc] etc.

{b Tip.} If you are using
{{:https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin}[merlin]} and [emacs],
issue a [M-x merlin-use topkg], to get merlin support for editing
the package description.

Now there are two things that are unsatisfactory with the above
declaration.

{ol
{- The set of files to generate for a library is usually always the
   same and it's painful to write them down explicitely. This
   is solved by [extension sets](#extension-sets).}
{- For the binaries, we usually don't want to install both byte and
   native code. We want to install one tool without the [byte] or
   [native] suffix, and the native one if available. This is solved
   by [auto binaries](#auto-binaries)}}

Using these features the above declaration can be reduced to:
{[
let () =
  Pkg.describe "jsonm" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/jsonm";
    Pkg.bin ~auto:true "test/jsontrip";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md"; ]
]}
Optional builds and installs are handled by declaring boolean keys
specified on the command line (see [Environment](#environment)) and
using the [cond] optional argument of install field functions (see
[Conditions](#conditions)). The following example compiles the
[vgr_pdf] library only if both Uutf and Otfm are present and
[vgr_htmlc] only if js_of_ocaml is present:

{[
let uutf = Env.bool "uutf"
let otfm = Env.bool "otfm"
let jsoo = Env.bool "jsoo"
let vgr_pdf = uutf && otfm
let () =
  Pkg.describe "vg" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vg";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_svg";
    Pkg.lib ~cond:vgr_pdf ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_pdf";
    Pkg.bin ~cond:vgr_pdf ~auto:true "test/vecho";
    Pkg.lib ~cond:jsoo ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_htmlc";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_htmlc.html";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_htmlc.ml";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_pdf.ml";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_svg.ml"; ]
]}

{1:exts Extension sets}

The install field functions have an optional [exts] argument. If
present these extensions are appended to the path given to the
function. The module [[Exts]](pkg/topkg.ml#L23) defines a few
predefined extension sets. For example a module library implemented in
[src/mylib.ml] can be declared by:
{[
Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/mylib"
]}
which is, effectively, a shortcut for:
{[
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.mli";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmti";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmi";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmx";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cma";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.a";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmxa";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmxs";
]}

{1:autobin Auto binaries}

For generating an installing native binaries if native code
compilation is available and byte code binaries if not you can use the
[auto] optional argument of [Pkg.bin] and [Pkg.sbin]. Using it with
[true] you can simply specify the binary name prefix. It will use the
base name as the name of the tool and ask for either a [.native] or
[.byte] target depending if native compilation is available or not.

{[
Pkg.bin ~auto:true "src/mybinary"
]}

{1:conds Conditions}

Conditional installation is handled through the optional argument
[cond] of install field functions. If [cond] is [false] it's neither
built nor installed. For example for a library that depends on the
presence of another:

{[
let otherlib = Env.bool "otherlib"
...
Pkg.lib ~cond:otherlib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/mylib"
]}

Conditions related to native code and native code dynamic linking
availability happen automatically:

* In [Pkg.lib] paths ending with [.cmxs] are dropped if
  [Env.native_dynlink] is [false] and paths ending with
  [.a], [.cmx], [.cmxa] and [.cmxs] are dropped if
  [Env.native] is [false].

* In [Pkg.{bin,sbin}] path ending with [.native] are dropped
  if [Env.native] is false.

{1:env Environment}

New boolean keys are added to the environment by calling [Env.bool
key]. To output a sample environment you can invoke the build script with
[--help]:

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml --help

{1:rename Renaming and installing in subdirectories}

By default install field functions use the basename of the path given
to the function as the install name. If you need to rename the build
artefact or install to a subdirectory you can use the [dst]
optional argument of install field functions. For example for a
library that needs to be installed in a [subdir] subdirectory of
[lib] use:

{[
Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library ~dst:"subdir/mylib" "src/mylib"
]}

{1:cmt Handling cmt and cmti files}

Since the OCaml tools generate [.cmt] and [.cmti] files only as a side
effect they are treated specially: they are not built. For
[ocamlbuild] you should add this line to your [_tags] file:
{[
true : bin_annot
]}
this will build them as a side effect of other build invocations. In
the [$PKG.install] file generated by topkg the [cmt] and [cmti] files
are prefixed by a ? so that if they are not built (pre OCaml 4.01 for
[ocamlbuild]) the install doesn't fail.

{1:verify Verifying the build invocation and .install generation}

For verifying the build invocation and the generated [.install] file
you can invoke [build.ml] with [explain] as the first argument:

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml explain human false ...

This will not invoke the build system but output on stdout diagnostic
information aswell as the build invocation and the generated
[$PKG.install] file.

In contrast to the build invocation it is allowed to invoke [explain]
with an empty or partial environment.

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml explain

In that case it will use [true] for each unspecified environment
boolean key.

{1:map Map from descriptions to targets and build artefacts}

Given an invocation [Pkg.{lib,bin,...} "$PATH"], the system generates
a target [$PATH] for your build system and expects to find the build
artefact in [$BUILD/$PATH] where [$BUILD] is the build directory of
the build tool (e.g. [_build] for [ocamlbuild]).

{1:config Storing build environment information in a build}

The following sample setup shows how to store build environment
information in a build. The setup also works seamlessly during
development if build artefacts are invoked from the root directory of
the source repository.

In this example we store the location of the install's [etc] directory
in the build artefacts. We have the following file layout in our
source repository:
{v
etc/mypkg.conf       # Configuration file
src/mypkg_etc.ml     # Module with path to the etc dir
v}

the contents of [src/mypkg_etc.ml] is simply:
{[
(* This file is overwritten by release builds. During development it
   refers to the [etc] directory at the root directory of the
   source repository. *)

let dir = "etc"
]}
the value [Mypkg_etc.dir] is used in the sources to refer to the [etc]
directory of the install. In the package description file
[pkg/pkg.ml] we have the following lines:
{[
let etc_dir = Env.string "etc-dir"
let etc_config () = match Env.build with
| `Dev -> Ok () (* Do nothing, the repo src/mypkg_etc.ml will do *)
| `Pin | `Release ->
    let config = strf "let dir = %S" etc_dir in
    OS.File.write "src/mypkg_etc.ml" config

let () =
  let builder = Pkg.builder ~pre:etc_config (`OCamlbuild []) in
  Pkg.describe ~builder [
  ...
  Pkg.etc "etc/mpypkg.conf";
  ... ]
]}
and the [opam] build instructions are:
{v
build:
[[ "ocaml" "pkg/pkg.ml" "build"
           "human" "false"
           "etc-dir" "%{mypkg:etc}%" ]]
v}

{1:trouble Troubleshooting}

More information run with TOPKG_VERBOSITY=debug, if you are troubleshooting
a pin build dont forget to add [--verbose] to [opam] itself.
